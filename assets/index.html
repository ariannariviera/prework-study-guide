      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML adds the framework of a website. It is used on every web browser you have ever seen or used. A good foundation in HTML allows other programs to work more efficiently.</li>
        <li>HTML consists of Elements such as; text, image, header and list elements.</li>
        <li>Descriptive elements are important for accessibility reasons (end users), but also in order to make it easier for the user to use. These could be elements such as meta-related, content division, & semantic.</li>
        <li>All HTML commands must contain an opening and closing tag such as <> and </></li>
        <li>The head element contains info about the webpage. Most of this is considered "metadata" and is used to make the website user friendly by describing things like the title (which is VERY important as it is the title for the webpage, and can optimize Search Engine Operations (SEO) or how easy it is to find your site), character limits, description, keywords, etc.</li>
        <li>charset sets our character limits, http-equiv sets an HTTP header for content, and viewport sets default view on our homepage</li>
        <li> The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>This designates the text users will see starting with the larger head which is within tags <> as "h1" all the way up to "h6"</li>
        <li>A "p" inside tags <> represents a paragraph or block of text. This is used OFTEN.</li>
        <li>Other body texts include "ul" - unordered lists, "li" - list items, "ol" - ordered lists are all ways to make different versions of lists.</li>
        <li>Another body tag is "img" inside <> and then "src" is the location of the image, this is not typically inside tags <>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS has 3 main styles; inline, internal and external. Inline is written within the HTML file, however, external CSS style sheets are preferred as they allow for Separation of Concerns.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns is the separating of code into different files based on use. This is a key design principle which allows for developers to indicate the responsbility of each section of code. This makes updating or maintaining code much easier.</li>
        <li>Selectors indicate the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations apply.</li>
        <li>CSS rules indicate there is a selector and a declation blocks. Declaration blocks contain properties and values. Such as "color" being a property and "blue" being a value or "text align" being a property and "justify" being a value.</li>
        <li>Margins act like margins in a doc and indicate space around an element.</li>
        <li>Padding adds space around content on the inside of an element.</li>
        <li>CSS Box Model: This is the principle that all HTML elements are essentially boxes.</li>
        <li>Selectors or the "*" symbol is a wild card that allows a CSS rule to apply to all elements on a page.</li>
